<h3>Bar Coupons</h3>

<p>For bar coupons, the following can be inferred:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People under 30 are more likely to accept bar coupons.</li>
  <li>Acceptance rates are higher when driving home.</li>
  <li>Coupons are more likely to be accepted when the passengers are friends.</li>
  <li>Sunny evenings have higher acceptance rates.</li>
  <li>Male drivers tend to accept more bar coupons than females.</li>
  <li>People with lower education levels tend to accept more bar coupons.</li>
  <li>Drivers without children accept more bar coupons.</li>
  <li>Drivers who frequent bars more than once per month are more likely to accept coupons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Coffee House Coupons</h3>

<p>For coffee house coupons, the following can be inferred:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People going to non-urgent places are more likely to accept them.</li>
  <li>Drivers with friends or partners have higher acceptance rates.</li>
  <li>Rainy days tend to have higher acceptance rates than sunny or snowy days.</li>
  <li>Acceptance rates are highest before 10 AM.</li>
  <li>There is no significant difference in acceptance between genders.</li>
  <li>Drivers under 21 have higher acceptance rates.</li>
  <li>Regular coffee house visitors tend to accept coupons more easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>These findings provide insights into the factors influencing the acceptance rates of bar and coffee house coupons. By understanding these relationships, businesses can better tailor their coupon strategies to target the right audience and increase the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.</p>
